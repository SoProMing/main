    "\n",
    "2. **Replace `.ipynb` Links with `.html` Links**:\n",
    "   - The `replace_ipynb_links_in_html` function reads the generated HTML file, finds any links to `.ipynb` files, and replaces them with `.html` links.\n",
    "   - This is done using a regular expression that matches the links in the HTML content.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Recursively Process Files**:\n",
    "   - The `recursive_convert_and_replace_links` function walks through the directory tree (`os.walk`) and processes all `.ipynb` files. It calls the conversion and replacement functions for each file found.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **File Paths**: Make sure to update the `root_directory` and `output_directory` variables to match your desired input and output paths.\n",
    "- **Dependencies**: You may need to install `nbconvert` and `nbformat` via `pip install nbconvert nbformat`.\n",
    "  \n",
    "This script will help you convert all `.ipynb` files to HTML and ensure that the links between notebooks are correctly pointing to the corresponding `.html` files."
